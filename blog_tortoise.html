                  is one of Kenyas Wildlife conservancies in 
                  Mount Kenya region in central Kenya. It was previously under indigenous forest cover and home to Kenyan freedom fighters.
                  Currently, 140 acres is under Dedan Kimathi University of Technology as sanctuary for ecosystems and wildlife. It is a home 
                  to 9 species of grazing mammals, 2 species of primates, amphibians, many bird species and reptiles such as tortoise.

                    <b><H5>Problem</H5></b> 
                    This blog describes technology solution solving a challenge of hatching tortoise eggs which take long to hatch
                    and are sensitive to hatching conditions. At DeKUT wildlife conservancy there are 6 adult tortoises. They were brought to the conservancy in the year 2012/2014 
                    from Tsavo, Mara, Amboseli and Nakuru parks. Hitherto, their number has been constant. After acclimating in the 
                    conservancy three months later they started laying eggs and buried them as a way of hatching them. Ever since the eggs never hatched. 
                    After some research by David, Rashid and Namoni, they found out that the temperature, humidity, eggs safety and Nesting grounds
                    factors inhibited the process.

                  <b><H5>Introduction</H5></b>
                  Ecology is changing and some animal species are facing extinction threat. Human activities, 
                  natural phenomenon and climate  change are the main factors. They affect their life,
                  natural habitats, food chain and reproduction. In order to conserve wildlife, animals species monitoring and tracking, 
                  technology aided breeding and wellness are given priority. Wildlife supplement various economies through 
                  tourism and help balance ecology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tortoise are very unique animals best known for their slow pace, ability to live very long (ancient 
                    historical life) and ability to adopt and live anywhere on earth apart from antarctica. In addition, 
                    they are know for the ability to keep breath for a long while among other intriguing features. 
                    However, hatching their eggs can be very challenging under normal conditions. They need warm environment 
                    where they can breed, a condition that is very rare to find naturally.

                  <b><H5>Environmental sensor development and Kaa IoT Platform</H5></b>
                  DeKUT wildlife conservancy started developing a tortoise hatchery project and in their preliminary work they designed a 
                  tortoise eggs incubator while focusing on their research findings. However, they lacked condition control and monitoring feature to 
                  regulate the temperature and humidity which are key conditions for hatching. They are kept at certain level throught otherwise diminishes chances. Temperature for 
                  instance determines their gender. Lower temperature produce males while higher temperatures females.
                  Also it is hard to determine their gender when they grow. Normal incubation period is 8 to 11 weeks. 
                  However, lower temperatures can lengthen the period. Therefore, approximate hatching temperature is between 26°C to 32°C. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Humidity is also important in hatching process. Tortoise eggs can be soft or hard shelled but most of them are hard shelled 
                  hence humidity required by each species may varry. It is hard for one to tell the level of himidity without the use of tools such 
                  as hygrometers or calibrated sensors. It should be mantained at about 70%. Low humidity causes pitting and collapsing of the eggs 
                  while high humidity causes bacteria growth. We designed and developed a temperature and humidity monitoring sensor 
                  node using Internet of Things (IoT) architecture and platform since they had developed the incubator structure.

                  achieved required hatching conditions. A 40 Watt bulb was connected in the incubator to control temperature, slightly wet sawdust, small water 
                  trough with water and sponge for humidity was placed at one corner of the incubator. Also tortoise eggs were put on a tray and placed in as well. 
                  Aeration was adjusted by allowing little ventilation on the walls of the incubator while relying on the sensor measurements on Kaa IoT 
                  dashboard untill a stable temperature of approximately 28°C  and 75% humidity was achieved. 
                  Device power was drawn from power extension nearby and the set up looked as shown in Figure 6.

                <b><H5>Conclusion and future work</H5></b>
                Using IoT environmental sensors enhances optimum hatching conditions. Temperature, humidity, egg conditions
                and nesting grounds significantly affects hatching process. The developed incubator protects the eggs from predators and harsh environmental 
                conditions. Water and bulb in the incubator enhanced temperature and humidity conditions. Going forward, we intend to include electronic relays for controlling bulb and mini fan 
                to automate the temperature and humidity control process. We intend to design and develop the sensor nodes with callibrated sensors for commercial 
                incubators. In addition, we will develop dedicated tortoise monitoring application for monitoring hatching conditions and alerts.
